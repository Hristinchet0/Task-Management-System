<h1>Task management app</h1>

<h4>Every professional has a lot of responsibilities and tasks to complete during the day. 
My app solves this problem by providing an easy way to organize tasks. 
Each task has a title, description and progress.The user can login and logout. 
The user can list all unfinished tasks, create new, edit or delete an existing task. 
Once deleted the task is considered done and is not visible any more. 
The user can export and download the tasks in a file format: Excel, CSV, JSON and TXT.</h4>
